# :zap: Its_URUGUAY_bot :zap:

A simple bot that corrects the various misspellings of **Uruguay** within Reddit comments. 

The bot was written in Python and is based in [talloViendoBot](https://github.com/dirkgentle/talloViendoBot) by [dirkgentle](https://github.com/dirkgentle), who also hosts an instance of the bot on his Raspberry Pi. As for the idea, it was suggested by [ElectrWeakHyprCharge](https://github.com/ElectrWeakHyprCharge) in [/r/Uruguay](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/).

I tackled this as a challenge with no previous Python experience whatsoever, so feel free to submit your PR's with better practices!
